# Report Generation Setup

## HPC Configuration

When running the `run_rep_gen.sh` script on the HPC:

1. **File Permissions**: Ensure you have permissions to access:
   - Input files
   - Model files
   - Docker/Singularity image
   - Python configuration file

2. **Output Directory**: Make sure you are saving the outputs to a directory you have write permissions for.
